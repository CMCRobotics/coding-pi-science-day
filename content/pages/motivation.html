             Over the past thirty years, the level of computer programming experience of students has fallen, owing to closed devices and a lack of easy access to development environments.
             
             At home, there might be a tablet or smart phone; at school, pupils are required to edit text or surf the web, but may avoid computer programming altogether.
             
             Often undergraduate or masters students have a poor level of computer knowledge.&nbsp; This prevents them from being effective at particle physics research, 
             which involves many types of computer programming activities. It also prevents them from being effective in many different commercial sectors that rely on computer programming.
             
             The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank" class="ext">Raspberry Pi</a> is an inexpensive ARM-based PC that can run LINUX and other operating systems.&nbsp; 
             Due to its low cost and flexibility, it is an ideal tool for many programming or electronics projects.&nbsp; Thanks to the large community backing its development, it's an ideal tool
             to initiate students to science and programming, and support educators in disseminating knowledge in an interactive and engaging manner.
