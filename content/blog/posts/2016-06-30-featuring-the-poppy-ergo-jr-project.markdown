I had the opportunity to catch up with Pierre Rouanet from the Poppy Project team.
The Poppy robotic platform is a research and education platform aiming at studying
human walk, suitable for research as well as artistic performances.

The [Poppy Ergo Jr](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/robots/poppy-ergo-jr) project is a robotic arm based on open technologies and hardware. It can be
fitted with different tools (a pincer, a lampshade, a pen) and programmed through [Snap](http://snap.berkeley.edu/),
a visual programming language that is a variant of Scratch.

Thanks to the Dynamixel servo technology, the Poppy Ergo Jr can also be taught a complex movement by example :
Show the robotic arm a complex movement sequence by forcibly moving it, and it can reproduce this exact sequence on demand.

As a preview, Pierre kindly provided a link to [the assembly instructions](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/assembly-guides/ergo-jr/).
