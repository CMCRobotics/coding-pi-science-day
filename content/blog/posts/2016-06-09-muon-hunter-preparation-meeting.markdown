The [Muon Hunter](http://www.muonhunter.com/) is a muon detector kit destined to be self-assembled
and let you measure the number of muons that are whizzing past you on their way across Earth's atmosphere.
This project is one of the four that will be showcased at our event.

Mihaly Vadai is an alumni of the excellent CERN High School Teachers programme and is volunteering 
his expertise to lead a workshop that lets you own and operate your very own muon detector.
Applications for the **Muon Hunter** are numerous, ranging from a Geiger counter to triggering pictures of a bubble chamber.

Mihaly has kindly accepted to design an affordable kit and a procedure that will let participants complete
their detector in under a day. Some elements, such as the GM tubes, will have to be procured especially
for the event. Some steps will require special attention, as the Muon Hunter requires the use of high 
voltage (albeit with low current, so risk of injury is quite abated).

We are very excited to feature Mihaly's amazing work and look forward to publishing more information
about his kit design on this very website !
